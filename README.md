# SimpleEQ  
Learn SMD soldering by building two channels of the kind of tone controls youâ€™d find on an old hifi. 

Top channel = Baxandall EQ, treble/bass cut/boost   
Bottom channel = Tilt EQ  

No voltage control, but just enough range to push sounds into distortion. 

Works well in a feedback loop.
